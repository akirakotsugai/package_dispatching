# Package Dispatching

I have created just one single file that does not need any dependency if you have python3 on your machine.
That's why the test setup is rather simple as it does not require unittest or pytest.

In order to complete the exercise in less than 30 minutes I could not spend time thinking of all test scenarios,
for that reason I admit I asked chat gpt free version to list all possible inputs for me, so I didn't check if
there are redundancies of some test scenario missing, and perhaps gpt free is not the best tool for that.

execute the test by running ```python3 test_script.py```
